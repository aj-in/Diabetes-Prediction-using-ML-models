# Diabetes-Prediction-using-SVM-


### 
In this project dataset was obtained form UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository.
###
Thankfully, data had fewer NaN values than most, and had standardized formats.

### 
The dataset was split using train_test_split function of the sklearn library.

### 
We train the SVM classifier using the training dataset, and ultimately predicts if a person is diabetic or not.


###
------------------------------------------------------------------

Update : In the second version prediction is done by using KNN (k-Nearest-Neighbors), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and decision trees.

A comparision between these 3 algorithms was performed for the maximum accuracy score, Decision tree classifier was observed to have the highest accuracy of 98.5%
