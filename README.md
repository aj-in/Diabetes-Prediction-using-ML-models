# Diabetes-Prediction-using-SVM-


### 
In this project dataset was obtained form UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository.
###
Thankfully, data had fewer NaN values than most, and had standardized formats.

### 
The dataset was split using train_test_split function of the sklearn library.

### 
We train the SVM classifier using the training dataset, and ultimately predicts if a person is diabetic or not.
